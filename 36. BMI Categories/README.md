### 36th ASSIGNMENT

BMI Categories

(This assignment was suggested by Joel H in 2012.)

The body mass index (BMI) is commonly used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in populations. It is computed by taking the individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by the square of their height in meters.

Start with the BMI Calculator you wrote previously (BMICalc.java). Then use some if statements to show the category for a given BMI.

Note: Although BMI is a very good estimate of human body fat, the formula doesn't work well for athletes with a lot of muscle, or people who are extremely short or very tall. If you are concerned about your BMI, check with your doctor.

### NOTES

Here I have given the opportunity for the user to choose whether to use the metric system or the imperial system. So and calculated the body mass index in accordance.
