## 63RD(63c) ASSIGNMENT
### Nim

Nim is a strategy game between two players.

Start by placing counters (coins or toothpicks or something) into 3 piles.
Player #1 picks a pile, then removes one or more counters from that pile. (It's okay to take the whole pile.)
Player #2 picks a pile, then removes one or more counters from that pile.
Player #1 plays again. (It's okay to choose a different pile this time.)
Whichever player is forced to take the last counter is the LOSER.
Write a program that allows two human players to play Nim against each other. The program should detect when the last counter has been taken and declare a winner.

This was a fun assignment, and the basic version is quite easy, but I wanted to make the code as complete as possible, so I tried to cover as many bonus points as possible, also trying to come up with my own ideas as well, such as trying to prevent the user from providing the program with wrong input using a try/catch block.
