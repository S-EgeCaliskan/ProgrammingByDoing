### 13TH ASSIGNMENT

Use several variables to store the names of your classes and their teachers. 

--

Here I wanted to further the assignment by making the schedule able to take unlimited variables, meaning it can store as many values as the user inputs, and then displays them in a panel.
I wanted to use a HashMap for this, which, even though it looks less elegant, is a lot more convenient and practical I believe.

Using the program is very simple. You simply enter a COURSE name, and then the corresponding TEACHER's name. After giving one key-value pair input, you can press 1 to add more, and repeat until you have as many pairs in your list as you want. At any point, you can enter any number that is not 1, and your list will be displayed.
